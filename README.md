With love, understanding, selflessness, and postitvity, we can and we will reach things that seem impossible. 
My Truth: One smile at a time, one win at a time, and huge changes that will last forever.
My name is Steven Cardenas and I believe that even the smallest voices have the potential to make a huge impact and save what humanity really stands for. Progression, care, understanding, and compassion. And that the best competition is curiosity as it encourages to grow, learn, and change.
To be more specific, my extensive amount of passion with my hobby, soccer, has allowed me to become a better person off the field, with my curiosity by learning from other better players.
In order to fight for something and have compassion for it, you don't have to experience it. You have to understand it.
Teaming up with the powers of positivity, cooperation, and patience, I am willing to strive for change for the better and am also here to prove how the internet allows positivity to pass even the strongest barriers.
